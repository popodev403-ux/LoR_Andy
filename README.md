# LoR [AI Code Review version.]


To whom it may concern, 

I am writing to strongly recommend Ms. Jyue-Ting Lin for admission to your graduate program. I am currently a Senior Modem Machine Learning Engineer at MediaTek, and I also serve as the Feature Project Manager (FPM) for our “AI Code Review” initiative. I had the opportunity to supervise Jyue-Ting directly for approximately one year, during which she worked as a Modem Machine Learning Engineer in our 5G NR protocol intelligence team. From my observation, she is a reliable and fast-learning engineer, and she ranks among the most capable early-career professionals I have worked with.

During her time with us, Jyue-Ting’s most notable contribution was to our “AI Code Review” system—an internal tool powered by large language models (LLMs) that helps automate code analysis for our 5G development teams. This initiative went far beyond a theoretical proof-of-concept; it was a production deployment integrated with Perforce, Swarm, and VSCode. When we planned to expand the tool from a local team rollout to a Business Group of over 2,000 engineers, Jyue-Ting took on key implementation responsibilities. She wrote and optimized Python automation scripts running on the Swarm platform and implemented a MongoDB integration to capture usage metrics for KPI analysis. Her backend work was careful and stable, and it supported scaling the service with no major interruptions. Based on our internal estimates, this automation has helped reduce repetitive review workloads and saves labor costs on the order of several person-years annually (we estimate roughly eight person-years for our division).

In addition to infrastructure execution, Jyue-Ting also demonstrated strong discipline in data preparation, which is especially important for generative AI work. She took ownership of the data pipeline used to fine-tune our internal LLMs (based on CodeLlama and Qwen). She curated high-quality QA pairs and processed 5G source code for continual pre-training (CPT), paying close attention to domain specificity and the avoidance of data leakage. With guidance from our team, she ran repeated experimental loops across model sizes ranging from 34B to 235B parameters, and documented results carefully for iteration. Her efforts were recognized internally, and she had the opportunity to receive the MediaTek V-Award for her individual contributions.

Jyue-Ting was also dependable in ongoing maintenance, which often requires patience and ownership. During the initial rollout stage, she acted as a primary technical responder. She monitored feedback channels regularly, resolved more than 30 distinct functional issues, and submitted over 60 change lists (CLs) to stabilize the VSCode extension. Her responsiveness helped us maintain user trust during the adoption period.

Finally, Jyue-Ting showed initiative in optimization beyond her assigned scope. In a separate project for Integrated Testcases Generation, she noticed that our log-analysis scripts had become a bottleneck for reinforcement learning training. She independently refactored the pipeline and applied a Transformer model with top-k prediction to reconstruct missing logs. This improved execution speed by about 10× and earned her a Distinction Award in our internal AI Innovation Competition.

Jyue-Ting stands out for her technical dependability and her ability to build stable, scalable tools. She is coachable, communicates clearly, and can take a high-level direction and turn it into concrete, production-ready results. I believe she would do well in a rigorous graduate environment, and I am happy to recommend her to your program.


Sincerely,

Yen-Cheng Lin Senior 

5G NR Modem AI Engineer, MediaTek
